            <p>My name is Chris - I am a current Computer Information Systems Student at Buffalo State College. 
            This fall 2019 is my first semester back in school, I had previously graduated from SUNY Brockport with a B.S.
            degree having studied History and Political Science.  The past four years I have worked in the insurance industry 
            holding positions as a Commercial Insurance Account Manager, Commercial Underwriter, and as a Claims Adjuster.
            I have always had an interest in all things tech and computers and after taking some lessons online and an Intro to CS 
            Java course at CC I have decided to go all-in to pusue further education with aspriations of becoming a Software Developer.
            I am currently on the hunt for interships for summer 2020 if you know of any good leads!  
            </p>
            <p>
            Of the many things I like to do in my free time my top hobbies are taking my dog Pax on walks, photography (I took the photo above!)
            and watching a good TV series.  Click below to learn more about me professionally and personally and please feel
